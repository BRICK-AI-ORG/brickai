# Tutorial 4: Edge Functions (AI Integration)

Supabase Edge Functions are serverless functions that execute on-demand, in response to HTTP requests. We can use them to run any logic that typically requires a server.

In a typical SaaS app, this is usually where you can implement the core feature that creates value. In our app, we're going to use it to call an LLM service (OpenAI) to automatically categorize new tasks for us.

### Edge Function Technical Detail

- Executes in a Deno (Typescript) environment.
- Can be built/deployed from our project via Supabase CLI.
- We can also configure it by specifying environment variables (which can include server side secrets), either via the Supabase UI or CLI.

### Edge Function Limitation

- 500K free invocations per month (then 2$ per million)
- Cold starts ranging from 200ms to 1500ms
- Max memory: 256MB
- Max function size: 20MB
- Max total runtime: 150s (free) / 400s (paid)
- Max CPU total (not include async/wait operations): 2s

So they are very useful for small, server-side logic and webhooks. But not suitable if you need long-running or compute-intensive tasks.

## Create and Deploy an Edge Function

In this commit, you should already have an edge function in the `supabase/functions` folder. But in a new project, you can create with this command:

```sh
supabase functions new create-task-with-ai
```

The boiler-plate function will come with some instructions on how to call it, and how to [set up the IDE for Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/setup_your_environment/) so your autocomplete works.

You can just deploy the hello-world function like this (make sure you replace `$PROJECT_ID` with your project ID).

```sh
supabase functions deploy create-task-with-ai --project-ref $PROJECT_ID
```

It will now have a URL endpoint like `https://[your-project-id].supabase.co/functions/v1/create-task-with-ai`. But if you visit it, it will fail because you are not authenticated.

## Testing an Edge Function via cURL

If you wanted, you can actually pass the authentication and test the function by adding the JWT token of an authorized user to the request.

Luckily, one of our tests can produce that for us. The token should last a few hours.

```sh
npm test tests/integration/2_auth.test.ts -- -t "can get jwt auth token"
```

Copy the token (it's a really long string) and update this request with your URL and token:

```sh
# Set environment variables.
export FUNCTION_ENDPOINT="http://[project-id].supabase.co/functions/v1/create-task-with-ai"
export FUNC_JWT_TOKEN=" eyJBUXXXX..."

# Call the function.
curl -i --location \
    --request POST "$FUNCTION_ENDPOINT" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $FUNC_JWT_TOKEN" \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{"name":"Pixegami!"}'
```

This should now work.

```text
{"message":"Hello Pixegami!!"} ‚èé    
```
